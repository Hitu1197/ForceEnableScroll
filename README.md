# ForceEnableScroll
Some website prevent from scrolling, especially after a paywall block or nsfw block (reddit lol). You can combo this script with your adblocker as a workaround for that!

Tested on: Firefox Mobile (Iceraven)

P.S Change ```automaticEnableDelay``` in 16th line as per your load speed (I noticed it works well on 2000ms delay)
